# Landon Norris Text Hover

A minimal Svelte recreation of Landon Norris’ text hover animation. Each word is split into letters, and on hover the characters animate upwards with a variable font weight effect.

- Original concept from Lando Norris [website](landonorris.com)
- Recreation inspiration from Scott of the Syntax team from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H34nxxVEgc)
